# plunkOrders ðŸ’«
A one-stop solution to place and review business orders, built upon ReactJs. 


## Problem Statement ðŸ’­
My friend runs a Marble-Granite showroom, where orders are beiing taken from the main reception section and then that written order is then passed to workers who'll further cut the marble as per the written order says. And, this was actually a very time-consuming process for which solution needs to be addressed.

## Solution ðŸ’¡
As a part of solution my friend suggested me to develop a web-app sort of thing which can be used in a two-step method. He's having some spare PC's which he can deploy for this task. So, it was decided that One PC will be set-up at the main reception section and another at the worker's cutting area where they can easily monitor the system and cut accordingly with an ease by enhancing the accessibilities of the orders. So, this way this web-app is an act let's say minimal but a real-time business solution to place, monitor and review orders.
